Given three numbers, you have to write a function named calcSum which takes these 3 numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
 

Input: First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line which contains three space separated integers A, B, and C.

Output: Corresponding to each test case, output sum of A , B and C in a new line.

Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=A<=100
1<=B<=100
1<=C<=100

Example:
Input:
3
1 2 3
5 6 7
2 5 3

Output:
6
18
10



{
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int calcSum(int a,int b,int c);
int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int a,b,c;
	    cin>>a>>b>>c;
	    int sum = calcSum(a,b,c);
	    cout<<sum<<"
";
	}
	
	return 0;
}
}

/*Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function is mentioned above.*/

/*  Write your function here */
/* The function should be named calcSum
    and accepts three parameters of integer type
    and returns the sum of the three integers */
    
int calcSum(int a, int b, int c)    
{
    // Your code here
    
    
    return a+b+c;
    
}
